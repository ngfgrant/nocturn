And\nso the purpose of this hub is to set our collaborative sights on growing the\nneuro-oncology clinical research community. We'd like to hear from you what\nyour priorities are and where your research interests lie; this is one of the\npurposes of this site. Equally important though are the needs to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create space for a group of like minded people to meet virtually and\nface to face, all of whom have an interest in improving the world for\npeople and their caregivers who are living with a brain tumour.</li>\n<li>Share collective intelligence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How does it work</h2>\n<p>This site provides an overview of the current clinical research landscape â€“ the\nview from the neuro-oncology bridge. There are some key structural features\nwhich underpin this landscape:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/priorities\">Priorities</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/trial-development\">Trial development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/training\">Training</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/funding\">Funding</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/fellowships\">Fellowships</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/guidelines\">Guidelines</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/links\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The content will be updated regularly but if we've missed something then please\ntell us.
