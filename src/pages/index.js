    <h1>Our purpose</h1>
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    There is huge collective intelligence amongst the neuro-oncology community.
    And so the purpose of this hub is to set our collaborative sights on growing
    the neuro-oncology clinical research community. We'd like to hear from you
    what your priorities are and where your research interests lie; this is one
    of the purposes of this site. Equally important though are the needs to:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create space for a group of like minded people to meet virtually and
        face to face, all of whom have an interest in improving the world for
        people and their caregivers who are living with a brain tumour.
      </li>
      <li>- Share collective intelligence.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How does it work</h2>
    This site provides an overview of the current clinical research landscape –
    the view from the neuro-oncology bridge. There are some key structural
    features which underpin this landscape: Niall – could this by hyperlinked
    please to the headings.
    <ul>
      <li>Priorities</li>
      <li>Trial development</li>
      <li>Training</li>

      <li>Fellowships</li>

    </ul>
    The content will be updated regularly but if we’ve missed something then
    please tell us. It's an organic, dynamic community and it changes all of the
    time. This is how it should be; static communities do not achieve anything.

    collaboratively the issues that need addressing. Simply by joining a
