# Our purpose

## Welcome!

There is huge collective intelligence amongst the neuro-oncology community. And
so the purpose of this hub is to set our collaborative sights on growing the
neuro-oncology clinical research community. We'd like to hear from you what
your priorities are and where your research interests lie; this is one of the
purposes of this site. Equally important though are the needs to:

- Create space for a group of like minded people to meet virtually and
  face to face, all of whom have an interest in improving the world for
  people and their caregivers who are living with a brain tumour.

- Share collective intelligence.

## How does it work

This site provides an overview of the current clinical research landscape â€“ the
view from the neuro-oncology bridge. There are some key structural features
which underpin this landscape:

- [Priorities](/priorities)

- [Trial development](/trial-development)

- [Training](/training)

- [Funding](/funding)

- [Fellowships](/fellowships)

- [Guidelines](/guidelines)

- [Links](/links)

The content will be updated regularly but if we've missed something then please
tell us. It's an organic, dynamic community and it changes all of the time.
This is how it should be; static communities do not achieve anything.

## Who

This community is a conduit for people to solve collectively and
collaboratively the issues that need addressing. Simply by joining a
conversation, you will help us understand more about neuro-oncology, so we can
make things better for people living with a brain tumour. So please, join the
conversation today. To sign up just email helen@brainstrust.org.uk
